      "First Time in the World UV-C Filament less light Sustainable Innovation
      For Coronavirus, CoV-2, Covid-19, SARS All Types of Virus&Bacterias Kills
      in 15 Seconds Only" Innovator Mandaji NarsimhaChary’s technology to
      generate optimum lux in a filament-less UV-C light (First Time In The
      World) that kills Coronavirus, CoV-2, Covid-19, SARS All Types of
      Virus&Bacterias, tested and validated by CSIR-CCMB (Government Of India)
      An Ultraviolet Box with filament-less UV-C Light with the technology of
      Lux Optimisation developed by a Rural Innovator Mandaji NarsimhaChary was
      tested by CSIR-Centre Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) on Coronavirus,
      CoV-2, Covid-19, and was successfully able to neutralize 99% viral
      particles. Mandaji NarsimhaChary who holds a Patent Granted for "Without
      filament reglowing the dead tube lights And Without Choke&Starter"
      explains, “When we try to increase the lux in the UV-C light more than
      what it is capable of, the filament can burst. The circuit technology that
      I developed could optimize the Lux to maximum using the residual mercury
      until it becomes 0 mg after the light is diffused. This is tested on 30
      watts & 254 nanometre-ranged UV-C light (could be performed on lights with
      different specifications) without filament, which is the first time in the
      world. This increased lux generated, as per CCMB was able to kill 99%
      viral particles at the tested time points, minimum at 15 seconds and
      maximum 1200 seconds when the virus sample is placed at 30 centimeters
      away from the light by utilizing and reducing Mercury from 100% to 0 %
      certified by Vimta Lab Mercury test Zero Mercury "Chary Formula", and save
      Environment also.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      But now world top companies don't have my system I have percent.... 60%
      life Only, remaining 40% life Mercury percentage dangerous for the
      Environment as the top companies don't hold a patent for without filament.
       Currently, Mandaji Narasimha Chari holds a provisional patent of the
      technology.” Expressing their happiness for having supported the
      innovator, CSIR-CCMB Director Dr. Rakesh Mishra said “It is very nice to
      see small entrepreneurs & start-ups coming up with innovative ideas and
      products. CCMB is happy to test, validate, and provide technical
      assistance wherever possible.” CCMB has also signed an MoU with Mandaji
      NarsimhaChary to further explore the technology in case of new
      interventions in the experiment either by the innovator or CSIR-CCMB.
      Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC Government Of Telangana) handheld
      the innovator in facilitating him through the various institutional
      validations required for the technology from the time they learned the
      technology. While the biological validation was done by CSIR-CCMB, the
      technical validation was done by International Advanced Research Centre
      for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI)(Government Of India).
